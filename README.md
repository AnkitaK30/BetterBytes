# BetterBytes
A program where the user can input ingredients to a dessert recipe. Unhealthy ingredients will be highlighted and 3 healthier alternatives are provided. If the user chooses to change ingredients, the recipe is accurately updated and then can be saved to recipe book, exported or deleted.

This repository includes the jar file of the program, all images required to run the program, and java files of all the classes
The java files have been uploaded to show the actual code. This was a group project and worked on by 3 people, the names of those who wrote the particular classes can be found in the header comments. To run code using the java files, download all with the pictures in the same file and compile BetterBytes.java (Dr Java used).
In order to run the program, both the jar file and all pictures must be downloaded and placed in the same folder (JDK required).
